        "This project fullfils the first set of assignments for the Vanderbilt CS5265-50 (Foundations of Machine Learning) class.  The project consists of delivering a machine learning application.  The building of the project will be done over the course of seven (7) weeks. \n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of the project is to:\n",
        "1.   Setup the environment for the machine learning assignment\n",
        "1.   Learn how to setup and use Google Colab\n",
        "1.   Apply literate coding techniques in solving an analytical problem\n",
        "1.   Learn to use pandas to solve a data exploration problem\n",

        "The author of this project is Matt Heilman.  The professor is Dana Zheng.  The professor has asked the author to select a dataset will meet the following guidelines:\n",
        "*   Tabular/structured/2D (i.e. rows and columns)\n",
        "*   $\\geq$ 5000 samples/records/rows, but no more than 50k rows\n",
        "*   $\\geq$ 7 features/variables/columns, but no more than 25 columns\n",
        "*   Independence between data points (rows in your data)\n",
        "*   Identify a dataset that you can use for a binary classification task directly or after transformation\n",
        "*   Diverse data types for your columns:\n",
        "*   Continuous variables (e.g., measurements such as weight, temperature, etc)\n",
        "*   Count variables (e.g., age, number of people in a classroom, etc)\n",
        "*   Categorical variables (e.g., gender, type of Operating Systems, degrees of severity, etc)\n",

At this point, the author is too ignorant to know what research gaps exist and this section will be updated before the final deliverable.\n",
